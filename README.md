Hydrological and Environmental Modeling of a Watershed in the Cerrado of the Federal District (Brazil) Using SRTM and RUSLE Data

This repository contains hydrological and environmental modeling outputs for a representative watershed located in the Cerrado biome, within the Embrapa Hortaliças experimental area (Federal District, Brazil). The analysis was based on SRTM-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and applied the RUSLE model and the GRASS GIS `r.watershed` module.

Data and Methods

- **Biome**: Cerrado (Brazilian tropical savanna)
- **Location**: Federal District, Brazil
- **DEM Source**: SRTM from Topodata/INPE at 30 m spatial resolution
- **Software**: GRASS GIS (r.watershed), QGIS
- **Models used**:
  - RUSLE (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation)
  - LS Factor
  - Flow Power Index
  - Topographic Wetness Index
  - Flow Direction and Contributing Area
  - Drainage Network Extraction
  - Vulnerability Index for Porous Aquifers
  - Soil Erosion Susceptibility Classification
